# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.4.2] - 2026-09-22

### Changed

- Stable GitHub releases publish the tested package through npm trusted publishing, with test
  execution separated from npm publishing authority.
- The npm package now has a clear description and links to its GitHub source page.

### Migration

- Run `npx workflow-toolkit@1.4.2 install` to update an adopted project. No new skill selection is
  required for this release.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-09-22

### Changed

- Ponytail skill descriptions state their scope and invocation phrases more explicitly.
- Core now includes the original `security-pentest` skill for authorized runtime testing of web
  apps and APIs, with a Claude skill alias. Ponytail Help names npm and Homebrew update routes.
- `wtk-deep-review` is recorded as a bundled local skill in `skills-lock.json`.
- Removed redundant installation tests for Deep Review and security skills; the canonical installer
  suite continues to cover package contents and installation behavior.

### Migration

- Run `npx workflow-toolkit@1.4.1 install` to update the managed skill descriptions and install
  `security-pentest` in core.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-09-22

### Added

- A shared code-reuse policy for frontend, backend, scripts, and infrastructure: find the
  canonical owner before adding an implementation and justify required differences.
- The core `wtk-reuse-review` skill checks implementation ownership and UI consistency in a
  diff or named scope, with whole-codebase audits available when explicitly requested.

### Changed

- Lean and modular Verifiers apply reuse review within their existing pass. Findings trace
  actual consumers, preserve domain and trust boundaries, and disclose unverified visual checks.
- Test additions require a distinct regression justification; consolidation preserves unique
  assertions, and recurring test execution must avoid redundant coverage and unnecessary cost.

### Migration

- Run `npx workflow-toolkit@1.4.0 install` and review the managed core additions and verifier updates.
- Existing applications can request `wtk-reuse-review` over the whole codebase to inventory
  accumulated duplication; routine verification reviews only the affected responsibilities.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-09-20

### Fixed

- Confirmed `jev-gateway` coverage takes precedence wherever the integrations overlap: gateway
  A/B/C plus adviser C/D/E becomes gateway A/B/C and adviser D/E. The explicit adviser handles
  only uncovered decisions; higher-level labels alone do not justify duplicate consultations.
- Standalone, disabled and unknown gateway sessions retain explicit consultation. A gateway
  installation or key alone does not establish active routing; hint and passthrough results
  remain the gateway's responsibility.

### Migration

- Run `npx workflow-toolkit@1.3.1 install` and review the shared adviser reference update.
- Launch gateway-managed sessions through your configured gateway and identify that session's
  routing state. This hotfix does not install or configure the gateway, bypass its transport,
  change workflow authority, or claim measured savings.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-09-20

### Added

- A core Jev adviser command for typed semantic decisions across planning, build, verification,
  review, QA, and shipping, with local previews, bounded API calls, and usage reporting.

### Changed

- Lifecycle phase instructions now consult Jev first whenever available, including direct phase
  invocation and decisions where the agent already has a preferred answer. Deterministic checks
  remain code-owned; agents retain action, approval, and verification authority.
- Consultations precede expensive context loading or investigation. Net token savings require
  comparing total Jev and main-agent usage; no measured savings are claimed by this release.

### Migration

- Run `npx workflow-toolkit@1.3.0 install` and review the managed core and phase-instruction changes.
- Reuse `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` from the caller environment or the trusted existing
  `~/.config/workflow-toolkit/qa.env`. No new key, browser runtime, or Vercel credential is required
  for the lifecycle adviser. Existing browser QA configuration retains its separate meaning.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-09-20

### Added

- Every Workflow Toolkit installation now includes the reviewed `security-audit-coordinator`,
  `security-spec`, `security-threat-model`, `security-implementation`, and `security-review` skills.
- Browser QA configuration defaults to `auto`: Jev first, Playwright MCP next, then one declared
  Orca or Maestri adapter, then manual.

### Changed

- Security skills are package-owned core capabilities installed offline through the normal preview,
  conflict, backup, rollback, alias, and adoption-manifest flow.
- Jev construction timeouts may fall back to Playwright MCP; timeouts after the action loop starts
  remain fail-closed until the fixture is inspected or reset.

### Removed

- The separate networked `install_security_skills.py` path and uncovered-security-gate warning.

### Migration

- Run `npx workflow-toolkit@1.2.0 install` and review the managed security-skill additions.
- Remove automation that invokes `scripts/install_security_skills.py`; no replacement step is needed.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-09-19

### Added

- Optional Jev-assisted QA journeys can classify bounded, non-consequential fixture observations
  through typed TypeSafe judgments while an independent oracle retains the pass/fail verdict.
- The Jev adapter defaults to a dedicated headless Playwright CDP endpoint, supports explicit headed
  runs, records allowlisted evidence, and falls back through Playwright MCP, Orca, Maestri, or manual QA.

### Changed

- Discovery and Lean planning skills use the current upstream slice-oriented contracts and clearer
  verifier routing and fixture defaults.
- Shared user configuration lives under `~/.config/workflow-toolkit/`.

### Fixed

- Jev preflight, trace validation, browser fallback, and evidence handling fail closed without
  exposing provider secrets or allowing the classifier to own the QA verdict.

### Migration

- Run `npx workflow-toolkit@1.1.0 install` and review the managed diff.
- Move any user-owned QA environment file to `~/.config/workflow-toolkit/qa.env`; credentials remain
  local and are not copied into consumers or package archives.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-09-16

### Fixed

- Explicit reuse, construction-order and approval requirements remain binding through planning,
  delegation, implementation and verification in Lean and modular workflows.
- Verification checks actual shared implementation and recorded prerequisite/approval evidence
  under every profile, instead of treating appearance or behavioral tests as sufficient proof.

### Added

- Shared context recovery reconciles contracts, Git, evidence, blocked work and authorization after
  compaction or resume. Phase boundaries checkpoint existing artifacts without mandatory session replacement.
- Host-neutral ownership transfers preserve frozen feature routes and require successor acknowledgement.
- Packaged references and generated instruction pointers include construction constraints and context recovery.

### Migration

- Run `npx workflow-toolkit@1.0.5 install` and review the managed diff.
- These changes add instruction-level safeguards, not automatic context telemetry or approval enforcement.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-09-14

### Changed

- Deep Review screens context candidates for applicability before reading bodies, while preserving
  applicable repository instructions, required references and complete source accounting.
- Small reviews prefer one cohort within existing engine limits; extra fan-out needs an explicit
  coverage or risk justification, without adding mandatory polish jobs or sweeps.
- Projects with browser queues avoid duplicate queued executions and replace only identified,
  stale, checkout-owned queued runs; running or foreign executions remain protected.
- Applicable human UAT narrows duplicate exploration without replacing required independent,
  automated or scenario evidence.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-09-13

### Added

- Delivery summaries include a stage-level execution metrics footer: measured elapsed time,
  available token usage, review rounds, remediation batches, validation overhead and reused evidence.
- Implementation and delivery entrypoints collect lightweight in-session receipts and request them
  from delegated workers; no tracked benchmark artifacts, additional gates or telemetry service.
- Verification–fix loop counts separate returns, completed rechecks and pending fixes, with model
  attribution and new, unresolved or regressed findings for each loop.
- Optional token-cost estimates use available billable usage and cited official provider rates;
  hidden usage remains unavailable, and subscription estimates are not reported as actual spend.

### Changed

- Metrics distinguish overlapping actor time, included gate time, provider counter coverage and
  unavailable usage. Missing telemetry does not block delivery or imply zero consumption.
- Optimization suggestions use observed causes; potential savings remain estimates, not benchmarks.

### Migration

- Run `npx workflow-toolkit@1.0.3 install` after publication and review the managed diff.
- Token availability depends on the active harness; this release adds an agent reporting protocol,
  not new provider collectors or automatic instrumentation of every model session.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-09-13

### Changed

- QA finishes safe independent paths on a frozen snapshot and batches findings; remediation pauses
  walks, and retests cover affected paths after snapshot identification and environment reset.
- The same non-author QA observer may plan and execute authorized bounded work and resume retests.
  Applicable charters are reused; probes follow named risks rather than mandatory quotas.
- Modular implementation reuses approved Swept dispositions and revisits only missing or changed inputs.
- Single-builder work no longer requires speculative handoff splits or token-budget arithmetic.
- Targeted instruction tests validate routing, metadata, safety boundaries and release consistency
  without freezing line wrapping or unrelated historical changelog prose.

### Migration

- Run `npx workflow-toolkit install` and review the managed diff. No dependency or cache changes.
- Independent technical verification, author/QA separation and impact-based validation remain required.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-09-13

### Changed

- Incremental validation selects regressions, owning suites and affected consumers from each
  proof's last green input baseline. Independent feature verification still accounts for every check.
- Review fixes and merges reuse unaffected evidence; full gates require a named unbounded impact
  or explicit human request, rather than a new commit or feature-close event alone.
- Isolated passes are diagnostic evidence, not automatic proof of a harness flake or a green full run.
- The proportional validation record names causal paths, selected commands and reused evidence without
  mandatory extra reports. Existing consumer-owned configuration remains preserved.

### Migration

- Run `npx workflow-toolkit install` to update the instruction references and review the managed diff.
- The existing gate cache retains whole-tree invalidation; this release does not add an automatic
  dependency graph or change cache algorithms.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-13

### Added

- Workflow Toolkit replaces the retired workflow identity with the `wtk` router, Lean artifacts,
  modular TLC entries, and namespaced quality and delivery skills.
- Optional `prompt-review` audits instruction bundles with read-only defaults, scoped findings,
  hidden-file discovery, and source-line citations.
- Four pinned security lifecycle skills cover specification, threat modeling, implementation,
  and review. Reviewed copies are versioned for local agents; consumer installation remains separate.

### Changed

- Consumer-owned guidance, proportional validation, and provider packet routing remain intact;
  completed Lean feature directories are transient and removed after promotion.
- Shared validation, evidence, test, Git, and artifact rules now live in
  `.agents/skills/wtk/references/`, loaded only when needed.
- Bounded skill and documentation changes use direct, scoped validation and reuse verified-base
  evidence instead of reopening complete feature verification or QA.
- Project artifacts, including code, filenames, specs, commits, and PRs, use English regardless
  of the conversation language.

### Fixed

- Claude aliases resolve to current skill names; obsolete aliases are removed.
- Successful and no-change adoption outputs explain the separate security installation and
  conditionally warn about uncovered security guidance.
- Installer updates retire unchanged managed guideline copies while protecting consumer edits.

### Migration

- Run `npx workflow-toolkit install` on a clean feature branch and review the complete replacement plan.
- Review local settings under the canonical `.wtk.toml` name; do not rely on retired configuration
  filenames or command aliases.
- Update custom references to the five moved workflow documents under `.agents/skills/wtk/references/`.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-09-11

### Added

- Graphify `0.9.14` is the standard architectural-intelligence tool for cross-cutting planning and
  conditional architectural review; Graft `0.10.1` is the standard code-discovery tool for
  exploration, implementation, and selected Deep Review.
- Checkout-local repository-intelligence state validates versions, freshness, worktree identity,
  bounded context, safe subprocess arguments, and controlled benchmark evidence.
- Guided adoption ships the repository-intelligence router and reports exact development-tool setup
  commands without changing application runtime dependencies.

### Changed

- Deep Review now defaults to on demand: absent cadence and fresh adoption resolve to `skip`; an
  operator explicitly selects `slice`, `feature`, or `grouped.N` to schedule review groups.
- Canonical Planner, Designer, Explorer, Implementer, and Deep Reviewer packets route architectural
  questions to Graphify and code questions to Graft before broad native repository search.
- Consumer-owned configuration remains preserved, and workflow/configuration changes retain
  proportional validation.

### Fixed

- Repository-intelligence execution handles tracked directory symlinks, rejects foreign worktree
  tools and stale state, preserves degraded status, and passes the required Graphify source paths.
- Graphify code-only setup no longer sends the invalid `--backend code-only` argument.

### Migration

- Re-run `npx workflow-spec-driven install`. Existing `.my-workflow.toml` remains consumer-owned;
  set `[deep_review] cadence = "skip"` explicitly to adopt the on-demand default in an existing
  checkout.
- Install the pinned development tools using the commands printed by adoption, then build each
  checkout's local graphs. Neither tool is an application runtime dependency.

## [0.10.1] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed

- The guided Node-only installer now closes its acceptance contract across packed execution,
  recoverable transactions, knowledge handoff, parity fixtures, path safety, and terminal transcript
  layouts at 80x24 and 120x40.
- The consumer-owned knowledge path remains subject to proportional validation, with explicit packet sync
  still validating its config.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- Shared workflow instructions now route through a small consumer-owned
  `docs/product/AGENT-CONTEXT.md` index. Fresh adoption initializes a neutral profile and
  re-adoption preserves existing product context, legacy prose, and `--skip-agents` behavior.
- Designer guidance now starts with constraints, reuses existing components read-only, scales
  alternatives to genuinely new screens or redesigns, and bounds exploration to one refinement.

### Changed

- The npm package identity is now `@antoniofulg/workflow-spec-driven`; the installed executable remains
  `my-workflow`.
- Provider packets and slice packets expose the selected product-context entry point without
  changing packet schema or budgets.
- Documentation, instruction, and mixed executable changes now use proportional validation and
  owning scoped checks. Deep-review, QA, and full-gate steps are selected by concrete risk or
  changed public promise rather than file count or feature wording.

### Migration

- Before updating, record installed layers with `adopt.py status` on a clean dedicated branch.
- Apply the same layer selection. A missing product index is initialized; an existing index is
  consumer-owned and preserved. Move legacy product rules out of `AGENTS.md` deliberately before
  replacing that file; adoption never wipes product data or infers the move.
- Templates install only when missing. Carefully merge changed templates into existing customized
  templates, retaining local rules, before an explicit packet sync.
- `--skip-agents` preserves `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` and skips local-config initialization and
  packet sync. Without it, apply performs normal sync; run `workflow_config.py --sync-agents`
  explicitly after any manual merge. Config schema is v3.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-09-04

### Changed

- Every confirmed deep-review defect now closes inside its originating feature run. Blocker and
  Major findings retain capped review rounds; Minor findings close in one remediation batch with a
  scoped gate and commit but no fresh proof cycle. Cosmetics and advisories remain follow-ups.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-09-04

### Changed

- Planner routing now recognizes `direct correction`, `UI-only correction`, `feature`, and
  `cross-feature change` as intent signals. Behavior-preserving, bounded UI substitutions and
  reference-driven refactors use one targeted integration validation; named behavior, data,
  security, dependency, shared-token, build, architecture, and unresolved-choice evidence keeps
  the applicable feature workflow. `issue` remains neutral.

### Fixed

- `adopt.py apply --layers full --skip-agents` no longer runs packet synchronization, so a 0.8.0
  adopted consumer without designer tables can install the seven phase skills before completing
  the documented configuration and sync steps. Explicit packet sync still validates its config.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- Phase skills `wspecify`, `wdesign`, `wtasks`, `wimplement`, `wverify`: each phase procedure is one
  skill an agent preloads alone; `workflow-spec-driven` is now the router (sizing, phase map,
  `.specs` layout, resume) and keeps the validators. Claude agent packets preload their phase
  skill through `skills:` and narrow roles carry `disallowedTools: Skill`; `--sync-agents` rejects a
  packet that preloads a missing or hollow skill.
- `/w` entry points: `/wspecify`, `/wdesign`, `/wtasks`, `/wimplement`, `/wverify` fork the phase
  into a fresh agent of its role and return only its summary; `/wreview` wraps `deep-review`;
  `/wqa [plan] <flow>` runs one QA phase over journeys tagged with the flow (`**Tags:**` line).
- Specify writes an `## Impact` section from two explorer traces with one no-regression acceptance
  criterion per affected feature, writes `uiux.md` for screen-bearing features, and offers a gap
  hunt at plan approval sized by scope; `validate_spec.py` requires `## Impact` for Large and
  Complex specs; `wverify` reruns the impacted QA scenarios.
- `designer` matrix role for Claude, Codex, and Cursor (AD-029): preloads `wdesign`, owns mockups
  under `docs/design/` and `uiux-review.md`; `wdesign` dispatches it before internal design.
- `Review-Signal` trailer on each delivery's merge commit (AD-025, AD-026) and
  `tools/review-metrics.py` reporting the reviewed fraction from git history.
- `tools/gate_cache.py` runs a gate once per tree and caches the passing result by tree hash.

### Changed

- `autonomous` merges by default once readiness is proven; a human go-ahead on ready work carries
  the same authorization, and the opt-out is stated up front (`stop when the PR is ready`).
- The QA history gate freezes evidence, reports, charters, and bugs only; scenario files are living
  status records and reset to `untested` when behaviour changes.
- `VERIFICATION-EVIDENCE.md` names the gate remediation loop and its cost; the raw knowledge note
  `2026-09-03-e2e-gate-remediation-cost.md` records the observation behind it.
- `workflow-spec-driven` drops prompt text written for earlier model generations: the 200K-window
  context arithmetic and its rendered token countdown, a model-tier rubric that contradicted
  `.my-workflow.toml` owning model and effort, the blocking per-task MCP question, and a
  keyword-to-severity lookup table now deferred to `docs/guidelines/REVIEW-ROUNDS.md`. Test
  integrity, planning, and progress rules are stated once instead of three times; the retired
  `context-limits.md` reference is removed. No validator, gate, or script behavior changes.
- Agent packet templates no longer restate the model and effort that `.my-workflow.toml` owns, so a
  reroute propagates through `--sync-agents` alone.
- Live Orca transport stays `blocked-verify`; Cursor headless dispatch uses full Cursor model ids
  (`BUG-20260903-cursor-route-bracket-effort-rejected`).
- `docs/workflow/roadmap.md` records the modular workflow programme (Linear intake, qualifier,
  global config, mockup fidelity, telemetry intake, deterministic installer).
- Workflow resolution derives its slice count from the validated `## Vertical Slice Closure`
  contract in `tasks.md` instead of a manually supplied number. A feature without `tasks.md`
  resolves to one slice, `--slices` is now an optional exact assertion on initial resolution and
  refresh only, and normal resume still returns the frozen snapshot without reading current tasks.
- Local `main` is reconciled onto the published 0.8.0 base. The local assisted-Orca executor and
  Bun test-runner variants are superseded by the released hybrid slice execution and Bun tooling;
  merge-alone slice derivation is scheduled for a re-port onto `workflow-spec-driven`.
### Fixed

- Claude Code resolves `workflow-spec-driven`, `workflow-config`, `deep-review`, `qa-plan`, and
  `qa-execute` by name again. The tracked `.claude/skills/tlc-spec-driven` link had dangled since
  the rename, so those skills silently fell through to whatever the host had installed globally.

### Removed

- Removed the optional ai-memory integration, including its repository scripts, guide,
  feature-specific test, and active QA promise. Session continuation is now a host responsibility.
- my-workflow keeps versioned repository artifacts and explicit prompts as the durable semantic
  context; adoption never removes external operator state.

### Migration

- Upgrading an adopted project from 0.8.0, in order:
  1. `adopt.py apply . --layers <installed layers> --skip-agents` installs the seven `w*` skills, the
     router, and the `.claude/skills/` links. Apply never removes files: delete nothing by hand.
  2. Templates are installed only when missing, so an adopted project keeps its 0.8.0
     `templates/agents/`. Copy the 0.9.0 `templates/agents/` over it (Claude packets gain `skills:`
     and `disallowedTools:`; every provider gains `designer`), then re-apply any product-specific
     lines you had added to a template.
  3. Add `[models.<provider>.designer]` tables for claude, codex, and cursor to the local
     `.my-workflow.toml`, copying from `.my-workflow.toml.example`. Sync fails naming a missing
     table.
  4. Run `workflow_config.py --root . --sync-agents` and confirm the three `designer` packets and
     the `skills:` lines in `.claude/agents/`.
  5. `--skip-agents` leaves `AGENTS.md` untouched; merge the 0.9.0 managed-block changes by hand:
     the remote-delivery bullet (merge by default, opt-out up front) and the designer in the roles
     line.
  6. Specs sized Large or Complex now need an `## Impact` section; add one to any in-flight spec
     before its next `validate_spec.py` run.
- Phase skills must not set `disable-model-invocation: true`; it blocks `skills:` preload.
- Cursor headless dispatch takes full model ids (`gpt-5.6-luna-high`); the `[effort=]` form the Orca
  route builds is rejected (`BUG-20260903-cursor-route-bracket-effort-rejected`).

- Operators who previously enabled ai-memory must follow the exact lifecycle commands in the
  [v0.5.0 tagged guide](https://github.com/antoniofulg/my-workflow/blob/v0.5.0/docs/workflow/ai-memory.md).
  This release does not execute or invent cleanup commands, and adoption never removes external
  operator state.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-08-31

### Added

- Bun 1.4 is the supported runtime, with modular `workflow-spec-driven` layers for incremental adoption.
- Assisted slice execution is the default: independent slices can run concurrently in isolated worktrees, while a single ready slice integrates serially in the checkout.
- Configurable project-scoped and machine-scoped test locks coordinate concurrent test runs.
- Legacy consumers can use `adopt.py resolve` with an exact, reviewable list of files to take over.

### Changed

- Remediation now reports real progress through the convergence ledger and preserves bounded stall decisions.

### Fixed

- First-use lock creation is serialized safely under concurrent adoption.
- Adoption resolution rejects target-controlled code and unsafe `.claude` parent symlinks at the trust boundary.
- Live Orca transport remains `blocked-verify` because the upstream `orca terminal send --text` limitation is not verified in this release.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-08-29

### Added

- PR #70's QA evidence and PR #73's hybrid slice execution establish the release's assisted-by-default workflow contract.
- Assisted slice execution is the default: independent slices can run concurrently in isolated worktrees, while a single ready slice integrates serially in the checkout.
- `workflow-spec-driven` replaces the legacy TLC path, with bounded slice context, independent proof, adaptive machine health, and exclusive-resource leases.

### Changed

- Tasks within each slice remain sequential; the coordinator owns dependency release, parking, continuation, integration, and cleanup. Adoption installs the pointer-only assisted probe with exactly-once mutations and read-only failure reconciliation.

### Fixed

- Safe cleanup and bounded ownership/effect checks prevent cross-slice residue and duplicate mutations. Live Orca remains `blocked-verify` because host terminal transport validation was not performed.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-08-25

### Added

- An opt-in parallel slice executor with `disabled`, `safe`, and `full` modes, deterministic worktree/worker follow-ups, checkpoint rebase/integration, and resource preflight.

### Changed

- Slice execution now preserves TLC task order while coordinating provider-neutral worker lifecycle, checkpoint evidence, and serial fallback for unproven capabilities.

### Fixed

- Lifecycle cleanup, recovery, and blocker convergence fail closed on uncorrelated ownership or external receipts; the real Orca/Codex two-lane journey remains `BLOCKED-VERIFY` and is not reported as a completed pilot.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-08-25

### Added

- Bounded parallel Deep Review with a default concurrency of 3, configurable from 1 through 6, frozen source inputs, resumable runs, bounded retries, provider-block state, deterministic reporting, and cumulative content-safe metrics.
- A configurable remediation stall bound of 3 consecutive stalls by default, with `0` selecting unbounded remediation.
- A direct-correction workflow for exact human-defined changes, centralized local provider runtime configuration, and model/effort routing across Claude, Codex, and Cursor.
- A refreshed adoption guide, autonomous scoped branch push, one pull request, and merge after readiness, and cleanup of merged feature worktrees.

### Changed

- Adoption now generates ignored provider runtime packets from the centralized local configuration while tracked templates remain the source of truth.
- Deep Review replaces the legacy `--workers` option with bounded `--concurrency` selection and preserves manifest-order status when refilling reviewer slots.

### Fixed

- Provider fallback and block state now survive interrupted or resumed review runs without refilling work after a provider block.
- Remediation edge cases now preserve deterministic progress and stall decisions across reordered or equal-size failing-test sets.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-24

### Added

- Opt-in ai-memory handoff across Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor with loopback-only, single-use continuity; adoption does not install it.
- Explicit reviewer isolation for internal Verifier and Deep Reviewer packets, with subagent capture dropping documented only as storage/noise control.
- Enable, reversible disable, re-enable, and separately destructive purge procedures for the operator-managed ai-memory lifecycle.

### Changed

- Codex handoff wrapper now finalizes only interactive launch modes and preserves the original child argv and exit status.

### Fixed

- Noninteractive and informational Codex commands no longer finalize an unrelated open session.
- QA runtime walks cover handoff delivery, single-use/no replay, the Codex wrapper/fallback/noninteractive fix, and the adoption canary. Lifecycle controls are documented and command-checked/dry-run only; reviewer isolation remains technical validation unless a later release QA session covers its documentation contract.

## [0.3.6] - 2026-08-23

### Added

- Optional Graft and OpenDesign integrations with repository-approved handoffs, source precedence, and safe writer boundaries.
- Versioned feature workflow state with safe migration of legacy ignore rules.
- Trackable Deep Review learnings and immutable QA charters with acceptance-criteria-mapped test cases.

### Changed

- Remote actions now require explicit authorization separate from local autonomous readiness.
- TLC validation honors the explicit `Verdict`; Deep Review uses the effective base and freezes source inputs before acceptance.
- Knowledge checks reject duplicate decision identities, record author dates, and run outside the repository bundle's full gate.

### Fixed

- Walkthrough comment publishing is idempotent, using PATCH for an existing comment and POST for a missing one.
- The full test gate now runs only canonical tests under `tools` via Vitest's scoped directory, so copied QA evidence cannot be discovered.

## [0.3.5] - 2026-08-22

### Added

- Authorized installation and onboarding for pinned external security skills.
- Scoped browser gate tags for feature-specific checks.
- Consumer-owned ad-index preservation during adoption.
- Source-only pack guide and versioned feature-spec guidance for worktree and gate consumers.
- TLC validator compatibility with generated feature layouts.
- Ponytail `full` activation across the complete workflow cycle.
- Deep Review manifests now handle symlink entries safely.
- Adoption supports opt-in preservation of existing `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` files.

## [0.3.4] - 2026-08-22

### Changed

- Onboarding now relies on the bundled TLC, Ponytail, and Deep Review skills instead of external installers.
- Documentation now states that the consuming project must have a Git HEAD before resolving workflow configuration.

### Fixed

- Adoption installs the bundled Deep Review skill and excludes Python cache files.
- Adoption rejects HOME-relative Claude TLC paths before writing and directs consumers to the project-local vendored TLC path.
- Configuration follow-ups strengthen schema validation and make cadence authority explicit.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-08-22

### Added

- Configurable deep-review cadence (`slice`, `feature`, or `grouped.N`), provider profiles and overrides, frozen workflow snapshots, and a default config example.
- Optional pinned Graft 0.10.1 context with plain-inspection fallback.
- Serialized reviewers and retries, plus observational content-safe token metrics with no usage cap.

### Fixed

- Adoption now installs the Graft ignores needed to keep generated artifacts out of Git.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-08-21

### Added

- Dedicated `deep-reviewer` agents for Claude, Codex, and Cursor.
- Dedicated deep-review pins: Claude Sonnet/high; Codex Luna/high; Cursor Luna/high.
- Agent matrix pins: Claude Opus/high planner, Opus/medium implementer and verifier, Sonnet/medium explorer; Codex Sol/high planner, Luna/high implementer, Sol/medium verifier, Luna/medium explorer; Cursor Grok/high planner, Luna/high implementer, Grok/medium verifier, Luna/medium explorer.
- Native-first deep-review dispatch with role-free Workflow fallback.
- Automatic remediation of blocking findings from round 2 without opening round 3.

### Changed

- Luna implementers use high effort across the agent matrix.
