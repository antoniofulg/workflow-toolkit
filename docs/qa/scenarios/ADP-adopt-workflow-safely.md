persona: Workflow adopter
journey: J-adopt-workflow
expected: Guided install, cancellation, non-interactive refusal, failure recovery, and idempotent re-adoption preserve all consumer-owned bytes while publishing only the reviewed Workflow Toolkit plan with exits 0, 2, or 1 as documented.

Covers `CWF-ADOPT-1` through `CWF-ADOPT-3`: resolver installation, tracked-source discovery,
managed-path review, initial profile creation, preservation of `.wtk.toml` and templates,
runtime regeneration, and the installed hierarchy/resolution instructions when adopted again.

Release 0.9.1 adjacent QA passed the real 0.8.0 migration and fresh full adoption. Seven phase
skills and links installed before designer configuration, strict sync failed without mutation,
eighteen runtime packets appeared on configured full adoption, package bytes survived, probe import
made zero Orca calls, and independent reload retained clean state.

For issue #36, fresh adoption must install the skill-owned AD index; after the consumer changes that file,
re-adoption must preserve its bytes.

For issue #37, `docs/toolkit/pack.md` remains source-only. Fresh adoption receives the other tour
pages, and its copied index omits the pack-only links when the guide is absent.

QA on 2026-08-22 confirmed the source guide and its two links remain in the pack, fresh adoption
omits the guide and both links without losing the other five pages, all remaining local links
resolve, and re-adoption preserves a consumer-owned sentinel byte-for-byte.

QA on 2026-08-22 confirmed fresh installation and identical SHA-256 before and after re-adoption of
a consumer-modified skill-owned AD index. The bundled-skill and release-contract canaries also passed.

QA for issue #39 confirmed initial adoption and re-adoption install byte-identical workflow validator
CLIs while preserving consumer-owned `.wtk.toml` and `docs/qa/README.md` byte-for-byte. The
deterministic package path extends that preservation to consumer knowledge and neutral fresh scaffolds.

For issue #41, adoption documents Ponytail activation at workflow start and points to `AGENTS.md`
for the full-cycle persistence rule. QA on 2026-08-22 confirmed the installed `AGENTS.md`, Ponytail
skill, and workflow loop keep that contract through every TLC and review stage, preserve the two
explicit exits, and survive re-adoption without an implementation-only competing rule.

QA for issue #27 confirmed adoption and re-adoption install a validator byte-identical to the source
while preserving a consumer-owned `.wtk.toml` byte-for-byte.

Issue #28 requires a fresh adoption against a target that already ignores `.deep-review/`: the
durable `.deep-review/learnings.md` must be eligible for Git while other Deep Review artifacts stay
ignored, and re-adoption must remain idempotent. The canonical smoke test covers the Git contract;
QA on 2026-08-22 confirmed that contract through fresh adoption and byte-identical re-adoption.

Issue #31 replaces the former opt-in handoff policy: `.specs/features/` is always versioned workflow
state. Fresh adoption must leave it visible to Git; migration removes only exact legacy ignore
entries, preserves unrelated target lines, and does not stage or commit consumer files.

QA on 2026-08-22 confirmed fresh visibility, exact legacy migration, byte-idempotent re-adoption,
unchanged `HEAD` and index, and feature-state handoff through a sibling worktree and clean clone.

QA on 2026-08-24 confirmed the ai-memory feature did not change ordinary adoption: fresh adoption
and re-adoption remained byte-idempotent and installed no ai-memory marker, binary, runtime DB, hook
tree, shell edit, or handoff file.

QA on 2026-08-25 retained this verdict as an adjacent canary: fresh adoption included the tracked
remediation example, re-adoption preserved a consumer-owned local config byte-for-byte, and only
printed the external security installer command without invoking it.

QA on 2026-08-25 reconfirmed the retained verdict for Parallel Deep Review: package membership
included all changed Deep Review surfaces; two adoptions installed source-identical files,
preserved consumer-owned bytes, retained tracked lock provenance, and only printed the external
installer command.

QA on 2026-08-25 found the `0.6.0` adoption regression: executor and adapter files install, but the
public `.agents/skills/autonomous/scripts/qa_parallel_pilot.py` lifecycle entry point does not. See
`BUG-20260825-adoption-omits-parallel-pilot`.

Fresh QA after `816afd6` passed the affected adoption journey. The pilot installed with exact source
bytes, an intentionally stale managed copy was repaired, two re-adoptions preserved consumer-owned
configuration byte-for-byte, and all 15 generated provider packets remained unchanged. The linked
release/package canary also passed; see the current report.

The hybrid-slice feature changes this public promise to v3 assisted-by-default adoption and adds
the pointer-only `.agents/skills/autonomous/scripts/orca_assisted_probe.py`. The implementation gate is not a user QA walk, so
this scenario is reset to `untested` until fresh QA confirms the installed tree.

Fresh QA Execute at `8257d37` retested the adoption-gate fix through a new disposable consumer.
Sixty-five selected managed files matched source bytes, probe import made zero Orca calls,
re-adoption preserved consumer-owned config and QA profile hashes, and package plus one-ready
serial-integration canaries passed. The closing full gate exited zero. Real Orca/Codex scenarios
remain `blocked-verify`; this offline adoption pass does not change that boundary.

The `phase-skills` feature adds five phase skill directories to the core catalog and makes `.agents/skills` a sync input in `_prepare_sync`; the set of assets a fresh target receives and re-adoption preserves has changed, so this scenario is reset to `untested` pending the 2026-09-03 cycle. Prior evidence remains historical.

The `specify-impact-designer` feature adds three designer templates and three designer runtime paths to `RUNTIME_PATHS`. Fresh adoption must install those templates and generate the six-role packets; re-adoption must still preserve consumer-owned local state. Reset to `untested`. Prior evidence remains historical.

The `lean-consumer-installation` cycle relocates installed runtime into owning skills and changes how
proven previous-layout copies retire. Reset to `untested`; the 2026-09-07 report and evidence remain
historical. Walk `CH-install-skill-owned-runtime-2026-09-08` from a final reviewed package.

The 2026-09-13 cycle changes package, executable, configuration, and managed skill names. Re-walk
normal apply and byte-stable re-adoption, cancellation with exit `0`, non-interactive refusal with
exit `2`, conflict/publication failure with exit `1`, and verified recovery. Preserve prior evidence
as history; it does not prove the replacement CLI.

Workflow Toolkit 1.2.0 adds five managed core skill trees and aliases and removes the standalone
security installer. Re-walk fresh install, no-op, conflict, cancellation, and publication rollback
with those paths included.
