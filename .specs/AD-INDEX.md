# Project decision index

One line per `AD-NNN`. The append-only body lives in `.specs/STATE.md`.

Body: `rg -A 20 '^### AD-NNN' .specs/STATE.md`. Resume: `rg -A 20 '^## Handoff' .specs/STATE.md`.
When recording an `AD-NNN`, run the bundled wtk-config ad-index.py in the same commit.

| `AD-001` | active | Agent always-on is a thin `AGENTS.md` (contract + pointers). |

| `AD-006` | superseded by AD-033 | Keep the workflow stack- and tool-agnostic while allowing optional capability integrations. |
| `AD-007` | superseded by AD-037 | `.specs/features/` is versioned, durable workflow state. |

| `AD-010` | active | Track `.my-workflow.toml.example` and provider packet templates, while keeping `.my-workflow.toml` and generated `.claude`, `.codex`, and `… |
| `AD-011` | superseded by AD-015 | Parallelization is an opt-in inter-slice orchestration layer above unchanged TLC; `disabled` is the default, `safe` consumes independent or… |
| `AD-012` | superseded by AD-036 | Parallel execution uses a provider-neutral deterministic coordinator whose adapters own external effects. |
| `AD-013` | superseded by AD-036 | The provider-neutral coordinator derives and validates a deterministic sibling Git worktree destination, creates that checkout with fixed a… |
| `AD-014` | superseded by AD-016 | Technical Verifier remediation is bounded per blocker fingerprint, defined by the requirement, root cause, and concrete failure path. |
| `AD-015` | superseded by AD-036 | Replace the vendored TLC phase-batch delegation with a workflow-owned, CC-BY-4.0-attributed spec-driven skill that dispatches vertical slic… |
| `AD-016` | active | A halted blocker fingerprint may resume only after explicit human authorization creates a new audit generation under that same fingerprint. |
| `AD-017` | active | Heavy test commands use an explicit named kernel lock separate from lane-wide resource-provider leases. |
| `AD-018` | active | The gate fingerprint is `sha256` over the gate label, the exact command argv, and the Git tree object written from a temporary index seeded… |
| `AD-019` | active | Cross-provider session continuation is owned by the host. |
| `AD-020` | active | Vertical slice count is derived from validated task outcomes that remain worth merging if all later slices are cancelled. |
| `AD-021` | superseded by AD-015 | When automatic host orchestration is incompatible, explicit human authorization may enable coordinator-assisted inter-slice execution throu… |
| `AD-022` | active | The assisted coordinator writes each complete slice packet to a coordinator-owned file outside every slice worktree and sends only a short… |
| `AD-023` | superseded by AD-015 | `assisted` is the default inter-slice execution mode whenever the frozen task DAG exposes independent safe slices. |
| `AD-024` | active | Merge the workflow-side assisted-parallelization remediation with the affected live QA scenario truthfully left `untested`; defer live Orca… |
| `AD-025` | active | One `Review-Signal` trailer per delivered pull request, carried on its merge commit, aggregating the feature through `slices=<n> verified=<… |
| `AD-026` | active | `check_commit.py` validates the `Review-Signal` trailer only when present; it never requires one. |
| `AD-027` | active | Round 2's Finding 1 is resolved as documentation, not code. |
| `AD-028` | superseded by AD-036 | Each workflow phase (Specify, Design, Tasks, Implement, Verify) is its own skill (`wspecify`, `wdesign`, `wtasks`, `wimplement`, `wverify`)… |
| `AD-029` | active | `designer` is a delegated matrix role that owns mockups and `uiux-review.md`; Claude runs it on `inherit`. |
| `AD-030` | superseded by AD-036 | The canonical consumer installer is the unscoped `workflow-spec-driven` npm package and homonymous Node.js 18 executable. |
| `AD-031` | active | Deep-review runs one discovery review per implementation group. |
| `AD-032` | active | `one-round-deep-review` is delivered with `bun run test:all` red only on `tests/installer` `IT-011` (frozen canonical packet bytes) and `IT… |
| `AD-033` | active | Graphify Labs `graphifyy` `0.9.14` and Nanonets Graft `0.10.1` are the workflow's standard repository-intelligence tools. |

| `AD-037` | active | Feature planning and verification artifacts are transient. |
| `AD-038` | active | `.wtk.toml` owns the consuming project's browser QA adapter selection through `[qa].browser_adapter`. |
