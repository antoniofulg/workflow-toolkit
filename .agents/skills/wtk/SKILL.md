# Workflow Toolkit

Use this entrypoint to select the smallest applicable Workflow Toolkit procedure. Keep the
router loaded and load only the selected skill and its directly relevant references.

For semantic decisions, follow [Jev-first guidance](references/jev-adviser.md) before choosing; phase entrypoints also link to it for direct invocation.

For implementation through delivery, start [execution metrics](references/execution-metrics.md)
before work or delegation; append its receipt to the final response, not a new repository artifact.

## Route

Load shared references only for the current operation:

| Operation | Reference |
| --- | --- |
| Plan, implement, refactor, or review code | [Code reuse and ownership](references/code-reuse.md) |
| Choose checks or reuse evidence | [Validation](references/validation.md) |
| Report completion or commit evidence | [Evidence](references/evidence.md) |
| Derive tests or choose their layer | [Test contract](references/test-contract.md) |
| Create a branch or isolate a checkout | [Git](references/git.md) |
| Promote or remove workflow artifacts | [Artifacts](references/artifacts.md) |
| Preserve explicit reuse, construction order or approval requirements | [Construction constraints](references/construction-constraints.md) |
| Phase checkpoint, resume, compaction, context pressure or session transfer | [Context recovery](references/context-handoff.md) |

- An authorized bounded documentation, instruction-only skill, or direct correction: the active
  agent applies the maintenance route in `.agents/skills/wtk/references/validation.md`, including declarative
  registration in an existing installer. Complete its scoped checks and local commit without a
  mandatory agent handoff. Escalate for a substantive behavior or authority change, not merely a new
  skill name, registry entry, CLI label, or pending merge.
- An unshaped idea, an open product decision, or competing solution alternatives: read and invoke
  `wtk-discover`. It may conclude build, build smaller/differently, not now, or do not build.
- An existing integrated Lean feature directory with `plan.md`, `checks.md`, or
  `verification.md`: resume the matching `wtk-lean` phase; do not route it to the modular entries.
- A decided feature without Lean artifacts: read and invoke `wtk-lean`, which runs Plan → Checks →
  Build → Verify using `.specs/features/<feature>/plan.md`, `checks.md`, and `verification.md`.
- A decided design or ticket that needs the modular upstream contract: read and invoke `wtk-plan`,
  which produces the upstream `.tasks/<name>.md` contract.
- An approved modular `.tasks/<name>.md` or `.checks/<feature>.md`: read and invoke
  `wtk-implement`.
- A diagnosis with no unresolved product or architecture choice: continue diagnosis directly; do not
  route to discovery merely because the cause is unknown.
- A user explicitly names a capability (`wtk-deep-review`, `wtk-qa`, `wtk-config`, `wtk-ship`, or
  another `wtk-*` skill): invoke that capability directly and do not reopen planning.

When `wtk-discover` resolves an idea that entered through this router, continue into the integrated
Lean route after the discovery decision. Direct invocation of `wtk-discover` retains its upstream
modular handoff to `wtk-plan`.

Ask only the smallest question needed to distinguish routes. Do not preload quality, UI, security,
QA, review, or delivery procedures; load them only when the selected route or changed surface
requires them. For Plan or Specify work touching runtime, configuration, dependency, public behaviour,
authentication, or authorization, read `docs/toolkit/guidelines/SECURITY.md` before coding, using `## 2. At
Specify — declare the surfaces` and `## 3. At the test contract — abuse cases get IDs` at their
named phases; use `## 5. At review — the residual only` during review. Do not run a broad security
audit without a matching trigger or explicit request. Before Design or Build work that adds or changes
a screen or interaction, read `docs/toolkit/guidelines/UI-UX.md` and any feature `uiux.md`; a feature with no
changed screen skips it. `wtk-lean` defaults its approved verification profile to `standard`; use `ui`
when binding interface sources are part of the feature.

The Lean artifacts and the modular entries deliberately retain their upstream names and schemas.
Completed feature artifacts are transient: after independent verification and selected local gates,
promote durable facts and delete the feature directory according to the lifecycle procedure.
