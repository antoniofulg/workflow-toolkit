# Workflow Configuration

Synchronize native packet metadata explicitly, then resolve the feature workflow once and let the
orchestrator dispatch the frozen route.

## Synchronize agent metadata

`.wtk.toml` is the checkout-local single editable source for every Claude, Codex, and Cursor
model and effort across planner, implementer, verifier, explorer, and deep reviewer. The tracked
`.wtk.toml.example` initializes it, and tracked `.agents/skills/wtk-config/assets/agents/` bodies are the source
for ignored generated runtime packets. Native packet fields are generated output; edit templates
for instruction changes.

Run:

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/wtk-config/scripts/workflow_config.py \
  --root . --sync-agents
```

The command validates the complete matrix and every template before writing, initializes a missing
local config from the example, reports `changed` and `unchanged` runtime paths, and is idempotent.
Adoption runs it after installing the missing example and skill-owned packet assets.

## Browser QA adapter

The optional `[qa].browser_adapter` key selects the browser QA route. Its default is `auto`; the
valid values are `auto`, `jev`, `playwright-mcp`, `orca`, `maestri`, and `manual`. `auto` tries Jev
for eligible non-consequential fixtures, then Playwright MCP, one host-declared Orca or Maestri
adapter, then manual. Direct values select only that adapter. Read the full execution and
safe-fallback contract in `wtk-qa-execute/SKILL.md`.

## Remediation stall bound

The optional `[remediation]` table has one key, `stall_attempts`: the number of consecutive
post-cap remediation attempts that fail to establish a new minimum of failing-test identifiers.
It must be an integer of at least `0`, defaults to `3`, and `0` means unbounded. The resolver
includes the effective value in its current JSON output but never writes it to `workflow.json`.
This lets an operator tune the bound between attempts without refreshing the frozen route.

## First resolution

Run the bundled `mutating` resolver from the consuming project root. For a Lean feature, it reads
the slice headings from `checks.md` before writing the feature-local
`workflow.json` snapshot atomically:

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/wtk-config/scripts/workflow_config.py \
  --root . --feature <feature-slug> \
  --native-provider <claude|codex|cursor> [--profile <name>] \
  [--override <role>=<provider>]...
```

With no `checks.md`, the resolver uses one slice. `--slices <expected-count>` remains an optional
assertion for initial resolution and refresh; it never owns the count. Normal resume returns the
frozen snapshot without reading feature planning prose.

Treat the snapshot as the persisted route and cadence; cadence defaults to `skip`, so Deep Review is
on demand unless the operator selects `slice`, `feature`, or `grouped.N`. The current JSON output additionally reports
the live remediation threshold. Cadence `skip` freezes `groups: []`: the route has no wtk-deep-review
stage and nothing downstream waits for one; the human runs `wtk-deep-review` later. The resolver owns config parsing, validation, balanced groups, role
precedence, agent-file lookup, and atomic persistence. Keep those rules in the resolver instead of
restating them here.

Done when: the snapshot exists, contains sequential scheduling, cadence, role routes, and frozen delegated
model/effort, the current output reports `remediation.stall_attempts`, and the capable orchestrator
has accepted every selected provider.

## Resume

Read the existing feature snapshot before dispatch. Use its `parallelization`, `deep_review`, `roles`, and `git_head`
values even when `.wtk.toml` has changed. Re-read the current `[remediation]` threshold on
every resume; it is deliberately live. Current packet metadata must match each frozen delegated
model and effort; otherwise synchronize and explicitly refresh. Do not silently re-resolve an active
feature.

Done when: resumed dispatch uses the snapshot's effective route and cadence, reports the current
remediation threshold, and records no new resolution.

## Refresh

Run the same command with `--refresh` only when the human explicitly requests a new resolution.
Review the resulting snapshot before dispatch because refresh may change review groups or providers.

Done when: the refreshed snapshot is valid and the orchestrator dispatches only its effective route.

## Provider availability

Check that the selected orchestrator can execute each provider named in `roles`. Halt with the
provider and role named when a route is unavailable. Keep provider agent definitions complete and
separate; use the `agent_file` selected by the resolver without merging definitions or silently
falling back to another provider.

Done when: every dispatched role has an available provider and its existing agent file.

## Failure recovery

Read the resolver's stderr and correct the named input before retrying:

- Parse or validation failure: fix the local config, example/template source, or CLI argument and rerun.
- Provider failure: make the named provider and role agent available; use no fallback.
- Snapshot write failure: restore write access to the feature state directory and rerun; atomic
  replacement preserves the prior valid snapshot.

Done when: the resolver exits 0 and the snapshot contains the requested effective route.
