# Tech Lead's Club - Spec, Lean

Run a decided feature through four moves: `PLAN → CHECKS → BUILD → VERIFY`. A human reviews the
feature shape before checks freeze its obligations; builders choose reversible implementation detail;
one fresh Verifier proves the complete feature. There is no task breakdown or component catalogue.

At execution or verification start, read [execution metrics](../wtk/references/execution-metrics.md);
include the assigned stage receipt in handoffs so the coordinator can report the delivery breakdown.

For explicit reuse, construction-order or approval requirements, apply
[construction constraints](../wtk/references/construction-constraints.md) at Plan, Checks, Build
and Verify. At phase boundaries or context recovery, use
[context handoff](../wtk/references/context-handoff.md).

## Core contract

1. Every check is one observable claim with a concrete value and a proof whose exit code settles it.
2. Tests come from the approved checks, never from the implementation. Do not weaken, skip, or
   delete a test to pass a gate; a wrong or impossible check stops for user renegotiation.
3. Approved `checks.md` and `Test policy` rows are fixed. New `Landing`, `Relations`, and `Surface`
   rows may be added when building discovers a door, entity, or route; approved rows are never
   rewritten. Keep `Flow` and `Impact` current when the path changes.
4. The coordinator dispatches one fresh Verifier over `<feature base>..HEAD` with every check in
   the same turn after the feature's last commit. The builder reports and stops; verification is
   never optional, delayed for another prompt, or self-authored.
5. The declared profile is a floor. Its report names the profile and `validate_verification.py` must
   exit 0. An approved spec authorizes local edits and commits only; push, deploy, and production
   data changes require explicit authorization.

## Profile

`AGENTS.md` or the feature snapshot declares the profile. The resolver defaults to `standard`;
`light`, `standard`, and `ui` remain valid upstream levels. The profile is a floor, not a preference,
and `checks.md` plus the verification report must name the same value.

```markdown
## wtk-lean

profile: standard
budget: 150k
```

| Profile | Proof obligations |
| --- | --- |
| `light` | proofs at `HEAD`, named tests exist and ran, one located assertion per check, level/sampling gaps, and `Swept existing` re-read |
| `standard` | light plus recomputed `Coverage`, `Test policy` verdicts, and one fault per assertion surface |
| `ui` | standard plus binding-source comparison and per-screen copy and arrangement enumeration |

An empty input costs a recorded line, not a skipped step. `validate_verification.py` rejects a
profile mismatch and missing sections required by `standard` or `ui`. If the declared floor is too
thin, ask the user to raise it rather than silently changing the profile.

## Artifacts

```
.specs/
├── STATE.md                    # Decisions log (AD-NNN) + Handoff snapshot
├── LESSONS.md                  # rendered by scripts/lessons.py - never hand-edit
├── lessons.json                # machine-owned
└── features/<feature>/
    ├── plan.md                 # problem, flow, impact, remaining shape, criteria, then audit tables
    ├── checks.md               # claims + proofs, the coverage join, test policy, swept
    └── verification.md         # the Verifier's report
```

Create each file when its phase produces content. For a change under roughly three files with no
one-way door, write only `checks.md` with an `## Intent` paragraph and skip `plan.md` - one
bounded escape, not a sizing matrix.

The plan is the human review boundary. Write the problem, walk the surfaces, write criteria, then
record the shape that implements them. File order serves the reviewer: `Problem`, `Flow`, `Impact`,
`Relations`, `Surface`, `Landing`, `Criteria`, `Traceability`, `Out of scope`, `Assumptions`,
`Observable`, and `Sources`. `Flow` is the path, `Relations` the entities and one-way constraints,
`Surface` the route/signature/statuses, `Landing` the literal irreversible choices and rejected
alternatives, and `Impact` what existing terms or data change. Placement and reversible
implementation detail stay in the diff.

`checks.md` derives proof-backed checks from the plan and joins every enumerated route, entity,
status, and door to a check. `plan.md`, `checks.md`, and `verification.md` therefore stay
distinct: the first freezes reviewed shape, the second freezes obligations, and the third is the
independent evidence. An unresolved architecture choice needs its own ADR/RFC/spike before it can
be recorded as a `Landing` decision.

## Phase references

- **Plan:** human review of EARS criteria, boundary, surfaces, nine implicit dimensions, and the
  five shape sections. Ask only genuine decisions; use `n/a - <reason>` where a dimension does not
  apply. Full procedure and closure gate: [plan.md](references/plan.md).
- **Checks:** derive proof-backed claims, join every enumerated set member, record swept landings,
  and close with `## Handoff` arithmetic: [checks.md](references/checks.md).
- **Build:** after the size gate resolves the execution mechanism, tests come from checks and
  implementation decomposition is yours. Keep new `Landing`, `Relations`, and `Surface` rows
  additive before closing code, then use the scope guardrail and handoff procedure:
  [build.md](references/build.md).
- **Verify:** in the same turn after the feature's last commit, the coordinator sends one fresh
  Verifier over the full range with every check; procedure and report schema:
  [verify.md](references/verify.md).
- **Memory:** decisions, handoff, and lessons live in [memory.md](references/memory.md).

## Scripts

Resolve `<skill-dir>` as the directory containing this `SKILL.md` and invoke
`python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/<name>.py`. Project data under `.specs/` stays relative to the
project root; pass `--root` when cwd differs. A non-zero exit stops the phase.

| When | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Before presenting the plan | `validate_plan.py <feature>` |
| Before starting to build | `validate_checks.py <feature>` |
| Before each commit | `check_commit.py --message "<msg>"` |
| Before declaring done | `validate_verification.py <feature>` |
| At distillation | `lessons.py add ...` |
| After editing a validator or template | `selftest.py` |

The validators own structural detail: `validate_plan.py` closes the human-reviewed shape,
`validate_checks.py` catches missing proofs, coverage, swept rows, and profile, and
`validate_verification.py` requires evidence, no surviving mutant, no `Unproven` member, and a
non-author Verifier. Run `selftest.py` only after changing a validator or template. If execution is
unavailable, perform the same checks by inspection and report the degraded path.

## Sub-agents and handoff

Estimate the files each slice touches from `wc -c / 4`, and record the arithmetic under
`## Handoff` after checks exist and before Build. When the cumulative estimate fits the declared
budget (default 150k tokens), one builder owns all whole slices sequentially; do not ask or offer a
transfer. When it exceeds the budget, stop before code and ask the user to choose the execution
mechanism: sequential whole-slice handoff at the recorded surface boundary, or one builder with
accepted compaction/context-loss risk. The coordinator chooses the cut, records the user's mechanism
choice, and uses the host's supported handoff mechanism and configured role/provider.

Handoffs occur only between slices and only after every proof in the batch is green. The outgoing
builder records closed checks, user decisions, and abandoned approaches. The next builder reads the
artifact and landed diff, not a narrative. Never split a slice or create a task DAG. The coordinator
owns checkpoint synchronization and dispatches the final full-range Verifier in the same turn after
the last batch returns green; builders report and stop.

## Knowledge chain

Use existing code and conventions, project docs, library docs (Context7 where available), then web
search; mark anything still uncertain. Never invent an API, flag, command, or behaviour.

## Output

Produce the artifact, lead with the verdict, and keep schema headings and identifiers unchanged.
For a concrete feature path, `.specs/features/lockfile-v2/plan.md` is reviewed before its checks;
the route then validates checks, builds, and dispatches the fresh full-range Verifier.
